#List rendering
1. make a list of data
2. display the array(list) the dom using the map method


#understanding keys
3. explain what the term unique is associated to key and how it important in react using real-world examples
4. using the key attributes to create uniqueness in individual items of an array(of an object)
5. using (element, index) "using index"
	


#Conditional rendering
First when we talk of condition, our mind goes back to the real-world-context.
Condition if either something is true or false, 1 or 0.
So condtional rendering works with booleans.

Tenary operator
? == denote true
: == denote false

syntax= Condition? condition ? <expression if true> : <expression if false>

Short Circuit 

syntax= Condition && <expression runs if condition is met>
